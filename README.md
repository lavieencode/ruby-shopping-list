# ruby-shopping-list
A simple Ruby shopping list program

A Treehouse project, using Ruby to create an interactive shopping list generator.

In this project, we were tasked with creating a basic shopping list generator program. As the proejct is part of Ruby Basics, there are no objects or prototypes -- just functions.

*Functions:*
**create_list:** Initially creates the list with the entered name.<br>
**add_list_item:** Pushes list item into the array key ```items```.<br>
**print_separator:** Self-explanatory. Prints 80 dashes for the start and end of the list printout.<br>
**print_list:** At the end of the while loop, prints the completed list with items and quantities entered.<br>

*Provided files*: None<br>
*Project duration*: About 45 minutes
